I will be building my first website using what I have learned so far from The Odin Project about HTML. I'm very excited because although I know that one day I will look back at this website and laugh because of how simple it is, I'm proud of myself for committing to learn programming on my own. 

P.S. Hello future me and whoever else is reading this. Have a great day and remember to be grateful for all that you have and for life itself :)
